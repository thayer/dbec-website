                <p>Ryan began his career as an engineer by earning his undergraduate baccalaureate degree in electrical engineering from The University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. Following professional work in the sporting goods industry, he earned a Master's degree from the University of Iowa in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on human motor performance and upper extremity biomechanics. After successfully re-tooling the University of Virginia Sports Performance (SPEED) lab, he joined DBEC as the resident biomechanics expert. His current research efforts are focused on developing medical devices to better diagnose/treat pathologies with symptomatic movement patterns. This includes better characterizing the in-vivo biomechanics of individuals both in and outside the clinic/lab including patients undergoing arthroplasty procedures, athletic injury mechanisms, gait in expectant mothers, and trauma.</p>
